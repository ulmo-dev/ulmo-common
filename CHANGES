Changelog
---------

**0.5.0 (in development)**

- nwis.pytables has been replaced with nwis.hdf5 which uses the
  pandas.io.pytables backend; things should generally run a bit faster now and
  the code is much cleaner. There is one backwards-incompatible change:
  nwis.hdf5.get_site() is now thread-safe. There was an undocumented behavior
  where if a site could not be found in the hdf5 file during a
  nwis.pytables.get_site() call, then a request to the NWIS service would be
  made and the site table would be updated but no longer happens. You must
  explicitly run nwis.hdf5.update_site_list() to update the site list first.
- the nwis.pytables namespace is deprecated in favor of nwis.hdf5 because it is
  shorter and more recognizable but pytables is still powering things under the
  hood (via the pandas HDFStore)
- parsed timeseries data dicts from waterml-based datasets (cuahsi.wof and usgs.nwis)
  contain parsed site info mapped to the 'site' key


**0.4.1 (released 2013-03-04)**

- ncdc.gsod.get_data() parameters renamed: start_date -> start
  and end_date -> end to be consistent with other dataset APIs
- ncdc.gsod.get_stations() now allows limiting stations to matching parameters
  (e.g. country='US')
- all date and datetime parameters are now consistently parsed
