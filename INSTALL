The most recent release of ulmo can be installed from pypi. Pip is a good way to
do that:

    pip install ulmo


To install a development version, grab a copy of the `source code`_ and run:

    python setup.py develop


.. note::

    If you're using the cache backend for USGS NWIS, you will need to install
    `PyTables`_ separately. For Windows users, a `scientific python
    distribution`_ that includes PyTables is recommended.
