Ulmo depends on a lot of libraries from the scientific python stack (namely:
numpy, pytables and pandas) and lxml. There are a couple of ways to get these
dependencies installed but it can be tricky if doing it by hand. The simplest
way to get things up and running is to use a scientific python distribution that
will install everything together. A full list is available on `numfocus.org`_
but `Anaconda`_ is recommended as it is the easiest to set up.


Once the requisite scientific python libraries are installed are installed, the
most recent release of ulmo can be installed from pypi. Pip is a good way to do
that:

    pip install ulmo


Or easy_install:

    easy_install ulmo


To install the bleeding edge development version, grab a copy of the `source
code`_ and run setup.py from the root directory:

    python setup.py develop
