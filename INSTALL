The most recent release of ulmo can be installed from pypi. Pip is a good way to
do that:

    pip install ulmo


To install a development version, grab a copy of the `source code`_ and run:

    python setup.py develop


.. note::

    If you're using the PyTables backend for USGS NWIS, you will need to install
    pytables separately as pytables dependency cannot be automatically resolved
    via the standard python packaging infrastructure. To install pytables, you
    may need to install numexpr first, then pytables or use a `free scientific
    python distribution`_ if compiling things is problematic on your platform.
