Welcome to the PyHIS documentation page
=======================================

What is PyHIS?
--------------

**PyHIS** (Python Hydrologic Information System) is a python module
that enables retrieval of time series water data from
WaterOneFlow/WaterML web services that are part of the national
CUAHSI-HIS system. It is a key part of the Python services stack
developed by the **Texas Water Development Board** for **'Water Data
for Texas'** - a unified hydrological information system that shares
environmental data for the state of Texas.

.. note::

   Currently PyHIS is under heavy development and should be considered
   alpha quality. We welcome anybody to use, enjoy, and contribute to
   pyhis, but we should warn that in it's current state there are some
   rough edges and the API has not quite settled down. So some aspects
   of pyhis will likely change with little warning as we figure things
   out.


How do I get started
--------------------

The latest release version of PyHIS is available on pypi and can be installed using
easy_install or pip install. The development version of PyHIS is available for download via
Github (https://github.com/swtools/pyhis ).
