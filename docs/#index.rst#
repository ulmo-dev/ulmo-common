=======================================

What is PyHIS?
--------------

**PyHIS** (Python Hydrologic Information System) is a python module that enables retrieval of time series water data from
WaterOneFlow/WaterML web services that are part of the national CUAHSI-HIS system. It is a key part of the Python services stack developed by
the **Texas Water Development Board** for **'Water Data for Texas'** - a unified hydrological 
information system that shares environmental data for the state of Texas.

Currently PyHIS is considered alpha quality. Although it is being used as the backend for several large projects at TWDB, the API is not stable and is expected to
change.
